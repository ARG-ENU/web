#### Sustainable Transport Communications Dataset (STCD)
<a id="stcd" style="visibility: hidden"></a>

This dataset is under continuous development to support research in behaviour change for sustainable transport and to provide an exemplar of practise in developing datasets to underpin reproducible & replicable Computer Science research. It has been reported upon in the following publications:

* (2017) [Abstract presented at the 2nd European Conference on Argumentaion](/page/outputs/publications/#pangbourne_2017_eca)
* (2016) [Studies in Logic and Argumentation 62, Chapter 34](/page/outputs/publications/#wells_2016_sustainable)
* (2015) [Abstract presented at the 1st European Conference on Argumentation](/page/outputs/publications/#wells_2015_sustainable)

The dataset itself is stored in a Git repository and is available via the [STCD website](https://github.com/ARG-ENU/STCD)

#### Climate Change Argument Dataset (CCAD)
<a id="ccad" style="visibility: hidden"></a>

This dataset has been developed to support research into visualisation of large-scale argument datasets. A goal in assembling this dataset was to develop a single, cohesive, large-scale dataset for a specific contentious real-world domain. The dataset is used in the [Argument Cartography](/page/project/argument-cartography/) project. 

#### Partisan Political Advertising Dataset (PPAD)
<a id="ppad" style="visibility: hidden"></a>

This dataset was constructed as part of research into the uses of digital technology to persuade voters. The core data consists of analyses and reconstructions of a set of political adverts that were used by leave aligned campaigns during the 2016 EU referendum and were submitted to a Select Committee of the  House of Commons Department of Culture, Media, and Sport (DCMS).

#### Moral Maze Dataset (MMD)
<a id="mmd" style="visibility: hidden"></a>

This dataset was constructed from the Art-Tech data release of BBC Moral Maze transcripts. The original data was published as a Word document. This was processed to produce a cleaned set of versioned data that is stored in a useable format.
