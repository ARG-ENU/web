#### Sustainable Transport Communications Dataset (STCD)

This dataset is under development to support research in behaviour change for sustainable transport. It has been reported upon in the following publications:

* (2016) [Studies in Logic and Argumentation 62, Chapter 34](/page/outputs/publications/#wells_2016_sustainable)
* (2015) [Abstract presented at the 1st European Conference on Argumentation](/page/outputs/publications/#wells_2015_sustainable)

The dataset itself is stored in a Git repository and is available via the [STCD website](http://github.com)

#### Climate Change Argument Dataset (CCAD)

This dataset has been developed to support research into visualisation of large-scale argument datasets. A goal in assembling this dataset was to develop a single, cohesive, large-scale dataset for a specific contentious real-world domain. The dataset is used in the [Argument Cartography](/page/project/argument-cartography/) project.
