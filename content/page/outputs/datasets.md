#### Sustainable Transport Communications Dataset (STCD)

This dataset is under continuous development to support research in behaviour change for sustainable transport and to provide an exemplar of practise in developing datasets to underpin reproducible & replicable Computer Science research. It has been reported upon in the following publications:

* (2017) [Abstract presented at the 2nd European Conference on Argumentaion](/page/outputs/publications/#pangbourne_2017_eca)
* (2016) [Studies in Logic and Argumentation 62, Chapter 34](/page/outputs/publications/#wells_2016_sustainable)
* (2015) [Abstract presented at the 1st European Conference on Argumentation](/page/outputs/publications/#wells_2015_sustainable)

The dataset itself is stored in a Git repository and is available via the [STCD website](https://github.com/ARG-ENU/STCD)

#### Climate Change Argument Dataset (CCAD)

This dataset has been developed to support research into visualisation of large-scale argument datasets. A goal in assembling this dataset was to develop a single, cohesive, large-scale dataset for a specific contentious real-world domain. The dataset is used in the [Argument Cartography](/page/project/argument-cartography/) project.
