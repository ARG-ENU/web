Canary is a Python library for Argument Mining. The goal is to make it as easy as possible to incorporate argument mining features into modern software.

The goal of Argument Mining is to automatically analyse arguments within natural language. There are currently very few tools available that help get this kind of functionality out of the lab. Canary incorporates implementaions of tools, techniques, and algorithms to enable your software to mine for arguments.
