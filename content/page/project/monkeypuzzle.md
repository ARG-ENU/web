There are two Monkeypuzzle tools; a rebranded version of Araucaria & a novel web interface. The aim is to provide argument analysis tools that are not dependent upon the cloud or other people's computers so that, if you are a researcher or argument analyst you do not have to risk your workflow to the goodwill or longevity of third-party research organisations or commerical companies.

## Monkeypuzzle (Web)

A free (GPL), open-source, web-based (HTML5, CSS, Javascript) argument analysis tool. This is available to use in three modes:

* As a hosted web-service
* As a local, non-server based single-apge web-app
* As a browser-hosted, offline app

The source code for MonkeyPuzzle (web) is available from the project repository which also hosts the issue-tracker to support ongoing developement. There is also a live, hosted version. 

## Monkeypuzzle (Desktop)

Araucaria was one of the first argument analysis tools, developed in 2001 at the University of Dundee. Unfortunately Arauacaria was not updated for many years, partly due to researchers moving to newer tools. However, Araucaria was the only GPL-licensed, pure argument analysis toolwhich meant that as other tools became "online only" or subscription based, Araucaria remained the only free, source-inclusive, argument analysis tool that analysts could run privately on their own machine. For many users, being able to perform private analyses of argumentation resources, for example, within research or legal argumentation, is critical, and externally hosted web-services are not an acceptable substitute.

As a result, Araucaria was adopted under it's GPL license, the code was added to a modern source-control repository, and regular builds were created to ensure that the tool will run under modern Java virtual machines. To celebrate this new lease of life, Araucaria was rebranded to Monkeypuzzle.
