With Argument Card Debate ([Ar:Ca:De](/page/project/arcade)) games we are building online and offline debate games that use 'Argument Cards', representations of arguments depicted using playing cards. The aim is to support people in engaging with both their own and other people's arguments.

Amantle Craviolatti recently attended the 2017 BCSWomen Lovelace Colloquium to present a poster and talk about her project with other Women in Computing. The poster can be [downloaded](page/outputs/publications) from our publications page.
