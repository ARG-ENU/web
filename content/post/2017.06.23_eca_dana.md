title: Poster Presentation on Argument Visualisation at Scale  
---
Dana Khartabil presented a poster at the Second European Conference on Argumentation based upon her Ph.D research. Briefly, we are interested in the tools that are needed to usefully explore increasingly larger datasets of analysed argumentation, whether this comes from hand-analysed datasets like STCD. This is part of the wider [Argument Cartography](/page/project/argument-cartography/) theme.

**SHORT ABSTRACT:** Argument diagramming has become a standard tool for visualising and exploring the structure of arguments and aiding in their analysis. The advent of digital technologies has lead to increasingly large datasets of analysed argument which can stretch the capabilities of traditional argument diagramming techniques and tools. We report on work to develop new argument visualisation techniques, computational implementations, that aim to support visualisation of arguments at scale, with ad hoc display and filtering of meta-data.
