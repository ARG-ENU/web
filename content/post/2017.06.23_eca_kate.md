title: Poster Presentation on Behaviour Change Arguments  
---
Kate Pangbourne presented a poster at the Second European Conference on Argumentation based upon our joint research into behaviour change campaigns and its associated argumentative practises. Briefly, we are interested in the kinds of arguments that are used in behaviour change campaigns from the Sustainable Transport Domain. This builds on work in to the Sustainable Transport Communication Dataset ([STCD](/page/outputs/datasets/#stcd)) theme.

**SHORT ABSTRACT:** Poor communication can undermine the preparatory work, conducted over long periods,  to construct favourable conditions for a major societal shift in behaviour. We examine the inferences that the designers of behaviour change interventions aim to produce in their target audience and the mismatch that can occur when interventions are deployed. Additionally we explore the related role and complicating factors that social media and digital technologies bring which can cause persuasive public communication to misfire.
