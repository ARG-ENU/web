Some good news to round out the week. I’m delighted to announce that my Ph.D student, [Dana Khartabil](/page/people/dana-khartabil), successfully made a defence of her PhD thesis, "Visualisation Techniques to Facilitate Argument Exploration", this morning and will be awarded her PhD subject to minor corrections.

Thank you to Professor Emma Hart in the twin roles of both panel and viva chair. Thanks also to Professor Jon Kerridge, who served as internal examiner. Finally, thankyou to Dr Panagiotis Ritsos of Bangor University, who was the external examiner. Dana’s supervisors were Professor Jessie Kennedy and myself (as Director of Studies).
