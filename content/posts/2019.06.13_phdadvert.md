Argument Mining, the process of detecting, reconstructing, and extracting argument structure from natural language sources has become a hot topic in Argumentation research in recent years. This is a challenging, multi-disciplinary arena whose questions go to the heart of classical Artificial Intelligence problems related to Knowledge Representation and Natural Language Processing.

ARG@ENU invites applications for self-funded PhD research posts in the above area. Applications will be accepted all year round and further details can be found on the [FindAPhD advert](https://www.findaphd.com/search/ProjectDetails.aspx?PJID=97323). Further enquiries directed to Dr Wells (s.wells@napier.ac.uk) are welcomed, however applications must be via the FindAPhD link.
