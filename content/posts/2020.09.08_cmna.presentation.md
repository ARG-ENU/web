Today Simon gave a presentation to CMNA'20 on the subject of "[Datastores for Argumentation Data]()" in which he talked about SADFace & the ArgDB as a way to store and manipulate argumentative datasets. MonkeyPuzzle was described as a method for eliciting argument data through manual analysis to form an argument analysis pipelein
