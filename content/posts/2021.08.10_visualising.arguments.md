We recently published a new research paper, entitled "[Design and Evaluation of Visualisation Techniques to Facilitate Argument Exploration](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cgf.14389)", in the Computer Graphics Forum. It's currently an [Early View](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/14678659/0/0) online version of record before it is included in an issue so citation information is not currently complete.

A "story of the paper" and demonstration page will follow shortly.
