After a hiatus of several years, there will be a [2024 Scottish Argumentation Day](https://edi-chai-lab.github.io/chai-lab-site/blog/) hosted by our friends in the [CHAI lab](https://edi-chai-lab.github.io/chai-lab-site/) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/).

It looks like there will be a packed day of talks from all over Scotland; Aberdeen, RGU, Dundee, St Andrews, Napier, and Edinburgh, as well as from further afield (University of Lincoln). This should be a great opportunitiy to get a really good understanding of the breadth of work being carried out in the "Scottish School of Argumentation".

I'll be presenting work myself, giving a brief overview of the [Open Argumentation Platform](http://openargumentation.org/). More information about that to follow....
