The DGDL is a domain specific language for describing the rules of, primarily argumentative, dialogue games. The language originated in the Ph.D thesis of [Simon Wells](/authors/simon-wells) where a prototypical version was developed. This was refined over subsequent years and described in the paper "[A Domain Specific Language for Describing  Diverse Systems of Dialogue](https://www.simonwells.org/publications/#wells_2012_dgdl)".
