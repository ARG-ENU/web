The OAPl project (pronounced "Opal") is an open platform for doing argumentation oriented computing. The core idea of OAPl is to combine different argument-oriented technologies so that they can address a variety of problems. Openness is a key design feature, both in terms of each core technology being open, but also insofar as the platform is designed to be pluggable so that any given tool in a data pipeline or toolchain can be easily replaced with an alternative to suit the needs of the problem domain.
