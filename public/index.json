Part of the aim is to facilitate the development of lots of argumentation software, partly it is to encourage different pieces of software to be able to be composed into more functional workflows, and partly to serve as a clearing house for software, so that we can become more aware of what is available.\nWhilst demo tracks at venues like COMMA are incredibly valuable for getting a good sense of the argumentation software variously available and in development, this happens every two years, and a more continuous process happening inbetweentimes might be useful.\nThe best places to learn more is throught the following links:\n The OAPl project page on this site: OAPl Project (ARG@Napier The website for the platform: http://www.openargumentation.org Or leap straight to the code \u0026amp; software: OAPL GitHub Organisation \u0026amp; Repositories  ","date":"09","image":"images/posts/comma20.jpg","month":"Sep","permalink":"http://arg.napier.ac.uk/posts/2020.09.09_comma.demo/","tags":null,"title":"Introducing The Open Argumentation Platform (OAPL)"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Today Simon gave a presentation to CMNA'20 on the subject of \u0026ldquo;Datastores for Argumentation Data\u0026rdquo; in which he talked about SADFace \u0026amp; the ArgDB as a way to store and manipulate argumentative datasets.

This poster forms parrt of the wider Argument Cartography theme.\nSHORT ABSTRACT: Argument diagramming has become a standard tool for visualising and exploring the structure of arguments and aiding in their analysis. The advent of digital technologies has lead to increasingly large datasets of analysed argument which can stretch the capabilities of traditional argument diagramming techniques and tools. We report on work to develop new argument visualisation techniques, computational implementations, that aim to support visualisation of arguments at scale, with ad hoc display and filtering of meta-data.\n Bibliographic Information Abstract (PDF) Poster (Figshare)  ","date":"23","image":"images/posts/dana-2017-eca.jpg","month":"Jun","permalink":"http://arg.napier.ac.uk/posts/2017.06.23_eca_dana/","tags":null,"title":"Poster Presentation on Argument Visualisation at Scale"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Kate Pangbourne presented a poster at the Second European Conference on Argumentation based upon our joint research into behaviour change campaigns and its associated argumentative practises. Briefly, we are interested in the kinds of arguments that are used in behaviour change campaigns from the Sustainable Transport Domain. This builds on work in to the Sustainable Transport Communication Dataset (STCD) theme.\nSHORT ABSTRACT: Poor communication can undermine the preparatory work, conducted over long periods, to construct favourable conditions for a major societal shift in behaviour. We examine the inferences that the designers of behaviour change interventions aim to produce in their target audience and the mismatch that can occur when interventions are deployed. Additionally we explore the related role and complicating factors that social media and digital technologies bring which can cause persuasive public communication to misfire.\n Bibliographic Information Abstract (PDF) Poster (Figshare)  ","date":"23","image":"images/posts/kate-2017-eca.jpg","month":"Jun","permalink":"http://arg.napier.ac.uk/posts/2017.06.23_eca_kate/","tags":null,"title":"Poster Presentation on Behaviour Change Arguments"},{"categories":null,"contents":"One of my honours students, Graeme Campbell, has been developing a mobile application to support behaviour change.
