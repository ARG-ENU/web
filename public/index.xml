      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m delighted to let everyone know that the 19th edition of the Workshop on Computational Models of Natural Argument will be hosted as part of the PERSUASIVE conference this year. Dr Wells, along with Jodi Schneider of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, is one of the new members of the steering committee and joins long-standing committee members, Floriana Grasso of the University of Liverpool and Nancy Green of the University of North Carolina Greensboro.</description>

      <description>Argument Mining, the process of detecting, reconstructing, and extracting argument structure from natural language sources has become a hot topic in Argumentation research in recent years. This is a challenging, multi-disciplinary arena whose questions go to the heart of classical Artificial Intelligence problems related to Knowledge Representation and Natural Language Processing.
Until 31st May 2018, ARG@ENU invites applications for unfunded PhD research posts. Further details and applications can be made via the findaphd advert:</description>

      <description>Dana Khartabil presented a poster at the Second European Conference on Argumentation based upon her Ph.D research. Briefly, we are interested in the tools that are needed to usefully explore increasingly larger datasets of analysed argumentation, whether this comes from hand-analysed datasets like the STCD. This poster forms parrt of the wider Argument Cartography theme.
SHORT ABSTRACT: Argument diagramming has become a standard tool for visualising and exploring the structure of arguments and aiding in their analysis.</description>

      <description>Kate Pangbourne presented a poster at the Second European Conference on Argumentation based upon our joint research into behaviour change campaigns and its associated argumentative practises. Briefly, we are interested in the kinds of arguments that are used in behaviour change campaigns from the Sustainable Transport Domain. This builds on work in to the Sustainable Transport Communication Dataset (STCD) theme.
SHORT ABSTRACT: Poor communication can undermine the preparatory work, conducted over long periods, to construct favourable conditions for a major societal shift in behaviour.</description>

      <description>With Argument Card Debate (Ar:Ca:De) games we are building online and offline debate games that use &amp;lsquo;Argument Cards&amp;rsquo;, representations of arguments depicted using playing cards. The aim is to support people in engaging with both their own and other people&amp;rsquo;s arguments.
Amantle Craviolatti recently attended the 2017 BCSWomen Lovelace Colloquium to present a poster and talk about her project with other Women in Computing. The poster can be downloaded from our publications page.</description>

      <description>People have long visualised argument structure in order to better understand and analyse arguments. Initially this activity was paper based and lead to a variety of diagram styles, for example, Wigmore produced a large and complex visual language to describe legal argument whilst Toulmin produced a compact and popular style for describing individual arguments.
Machines were used to support argument analysis and visualisation, leading to software such as Araucaria and Rationale, which define their own versions of the standard argument diagram familiar from basic logic.</description>

      <description>Sustainable Transport Communications Dataset (STCD) 
This dataset is under continuous development to support research in behaviour change for sustainable transport and to provide an exemplar of practise in developing datasets to underpin reproducible &amp;amp; replicable Computer Science research. It has been reported upon in the following publications:
 (2017) Abstract presented at the 2nd European Conference on Argumentaion (2016) Studies in Logic and Argumentation 62, Chapter 34 (2015) Abstract presented at the 1st European Conference on Argumentation  The dataset itself is stored in a Git repository and is available via the STCD website</description>

      <description>Much argumentation research begins with analysis of real world examples. Even as we move towards compuational argumentation systems, there is still much that can be learned from examining how people interact argumentatively. The MonkeyPuzzle tools aim to provide graphical interfaces to a suite of tools for analysing, storing, and working with argument resources.
Our tools come in two flavours, a Browser-hosted web application and a Desktop-based Java applications (which is essentially Araucaria built for a modern JVM).</description>

      <description>SADFace is a simple JSON based Argument description format, software library, and supporting tools to enable developers and researchers to describe arguments then easily reuse their data. The goal is to make it as easy as possible to incorporate argument data into modern software.
There are a number of argument description and markup languages, for example, the Argument Markup Language (AML) and the Argument Interchange Format (AIF). Both have their advantages and disadvantages, AML is a simple tree-based format, but is a pain to parse, and requires an XML toolchain, something that is falling out of favour amongst main-stream web toolchains.</description>

Simon Wells is a lecturer in the School of Computing at Edinburgh Napier University. His research interests lie generally in Artificial Intelligence with a specific focus on reasoning, decision-making, and strategic interaction achieved via formal and applied argumentation-based techniques. Generally, he is interested in how argumentation can be used to understand the world, resolve conflicts, and influence others. He maintains ARG@ENU and does Argumentation Research to develops argument-mining, dialogue management, and behaviour change tools.</description>

Manual Argument Analysis Monkeypuzzle is a web-based tool that has been developed at ENU over the last few years. It currently support analysis of plain text and the visualisation of the results, but we&amp;rsquo;d like to extend this to deal with multi-modal arguments and arguments expressed in different media, for example,</description>
