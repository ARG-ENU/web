      <description>After a hiatus of several years, there will be a 2024 Scottish Argumentation Day hosted by our friends in the CHAI lab at the University of Edinburgh.
It looks like there will be a packed day of talks from all over Scotland; Aberdeen, RGU, Dundee, St Andrews, Napier, and Edinburgh, as well as from further afield (University of Lincoln). This should be a great opportunitiy to get a really good understanding of the breadth of work being carried out in the &amp;ldquo;Scottish School of Argumentation&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>We recently published a new research paper, entitled &amp;ldquo;Design and Evaluation of Visualisation Techniques to Facilitate Argument Exploration&amp;rdquo;, in the Computer Graphics Forum. It&amp;rsquo;s currently an Early View online version of record before it is included in an issue so citation information is not currently complete.
A &amp;ldquo;story of the paper&amp;rdquo; and demonstration page will follow shortly.</description>

      <title>Dana&#39;s Ph.D Thesis Published</title>

      <guid>http://arg.napier.ac.uk/posts/2020.11.10_dana-thesis/</guid>
      <description>Today Dana&amp;rsquo;s Ph.D Theisis entitled &amp;ldquo;Visualisation techniques to facilitate argument exploration&amp;rdquo; was published to the Napier research archive. This is the abstract:
 Visualisation is a graphical representation that is used to aid understanding and gain insight into information. Similarly, visualising arguments can help people to explore argument structure and comprehend knowledge associated with tough problems.  In this thesis, we focus on representing arguments, especially when data size increase, which causes difficulty in exploring and understanding arguments.</description>

      <title>Introducing The Open Argumentation Platform (OAPl)</title>

      <description>Today Simon gave a demo at COMMA 2020 on the subject of &amp;ldquo;The Open Argumentation PLatform (OAPl)&amp;rdquo; in which he talked about the various pieces of software (some more mature, some more exploratory and prototypical) which form the inital tranch of contributions to a nascent Open Platform for Argumentation Software. Part of the aim is to facilitate the development of lots of argumentation software, partly it is to encourage different pieces of software to be able to be composed into more functional workflows, and partly to serve as a clearing house for software, so that we can become more aware of what is available.</description>

      <description>Today Simon gave a presentation to CMNA&#39;20 on the subject of &amp;ldquo;Datastores for Argumentation Data&amp;rdquo; in which he talked about SADFace &amp;amp; the ArgDB as a way to store and manipulate argumentative datasets. MonkeyPuzzle was described as a method for eliciting argument data through manual analysis to form an argument analysis pipeline.
The following links will take you directly to the project pages for each of the three software tools that I talked about today:</description>

      <title>Self Funded Ph.D Research Posts in Argument Mining</title>
      <link>http://arg.napier.ac.uk/posts/2019.06.13_phdadvert/</link>

      <description>Argument Mining, the process of detecting, reconstructing, and extracting argument structure from natural language sources has become a hot topic in Argumentation research in recent years. This is a challenging, multi-disciplinary arena whose questions go to the heart of classical Artificial Intelligence problems related to Knowledge Representation and Natural Language Processing.
ARG@ENU invites applications for self-funded PhD research posts in the above area. Applications will be accepted all year round and further details can be found on the FindAPhD advert.</description>

      <description>Dana Khartabil presented a poster at the Second European Conference on Argumentation based upon her Ph.D research. Briefly, we are interested in the tools that are needed to usefully explore increasingly larger datasets of analysed argumentation, whether this comes from hand-analysed datasets like the STCD. This poster forms parrt of the wider Argument Cartography theme.
SHORT ABSTRACT: Argument diagramming has become a standard tool for visualising and exploring the structure of arguments and aiding in their analysis.</description>

      <description>Kate Pangbourne presented a poster at the Second European Conference on Argumentation based upon our joint research into behaviour change campaigns and its associated argumentative practises. Briefly, we are interested in the kinds of arguments that are used in behaviour change campaigns from the Sustainable Transport Domain. This builds on work in to the Sustainable Transport Communication Dataset (STCD) theme.
SHORT ABSTRACT: Poor communication can undermine the preparatory work, conducted over long periods, to construct favourable conditions for a major societal shift in behaviour.</description>

      <description>With Argument Card Debate (Ar:Ca:De) games we are building online and offline debate games that use &amp;lsquo;Argument Cards&amp;rsquo;, representations of arguments depicted using playing cards. The aim is to support people in engaging with both their own and other people&amp;rsquo;s arguments.
Amantle Craviolatti recently attended the 2017 BCSWomen Lovelace Colloquium to present a poster and talk about her project with other Women in Computing. The poster can be downloaded from our publications page.</description>
