      <description>Some good news to round out the week. Iâ€™m delighted to announce that my Ph.D student, Dana Khartabil, successfully made a defence of her PhD thesis, &amp;ldquo;Visualisation Techniques to Facilitate Argument Exploration&amp;rdquo;, this morning and will be awarded her PhD subject to minor corrections.
Thank you to Professor Emma Hart in the twin roles of both panel and viva chair. Thanks also to Professor Jon Kerridge, who served as internal examiner.</description>

      <description>Argument Mining, the process of detecting, reconstructing, and extracting argument structure from natural language sources has become a hot topic in Argumentation research in recent years. This is a challenging, multi-disciplinary arena whose questions go to the heart of classical Artificial Intelligence problems related to Knowledge Representation and Natural Language Processing.
ARG@ENU invites applications for self-funded PhD research posts in the above area. Applications will be accepted all year round and further details can be found on the FindAPhD advert.</description>
